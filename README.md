# clone-pinterest
Created a full-stack Pinterest clone with user authentication, including signup, login, and profile creation. Users can upload and manage images, view a masonry-style image feed, and update their profiles. The app follows MVC architecture, uses RESTful APIs, and includes responsive design with dynamic rendering and secure session handling.
